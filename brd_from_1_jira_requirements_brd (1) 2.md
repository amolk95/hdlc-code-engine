## 2. PROJECT BACKGROUND

### Business Context and Drivers
The company has identified a need to improve the accuracy and speed of detecting anomalies in its weekly sales data. Traditional manual methods are proving insufficient due to the growing volume of data. Implementing an automated anomaly detection system will address these challenges.

### Problem Statement
Manual detection of anomalies in sales data is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to potential revenue losses and delayed responses to market changes.

### Current State Analysis
Currently, sales data is monitored and analyzed manually, which is error-prone and inefficient, resulting in delays and potential inaccuracies in identifying data anomalies.

### Future State Vision
The desired future state is an automated system capable of analyzing weekly sales data, detecting anomalies with high accuracy, and providing actionable insights in real-time.

## 3. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

### Primary Business Goals
- Automate the detection of anomalies in weekly sales data.
- Improve the accuracy and speed of anomaly detection.
- Provide real-time alerts and reports for quick decision-making.

### Secondary Objectives
- Reduce dependency on manual data analysis.
- Enhance data-driven strategic decisions.
- Improve overall data integrity and operational efficiency.

### Success Metrics and KPIs
- Reduction in time taken to detect anomalies by 50%.
- Increase in the accuracy of anomaly detection by 30%.
- Improvement in response time to detected anomalies by 40%.

### Business Value Proposition
Automating anomaly detection in sales data will result in increased operational efficiency, reduced revenue losses, and improved decision-making, offering a significant competitive advantage.
